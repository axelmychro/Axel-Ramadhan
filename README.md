## Contingency Contract

Built to showcase my projects and how I think about frontend development. The design is inspired by [Arknights](https://www.arknights.global/) interfaces with strong contrast and UI that feels closer to a terminal than a marketing page.

### Philosophy

Clear layouts, readable typography, and intentional motion.  
This site focuses on visual contrast and smooth transitions, so the content stays readable while still feeling alive.

Layouts are deliberately restructured, typography is chosen for clarity, and motion is used sparingly to guide attention rather than decorate to make content feel operational, not ornamental.

### Features

- **Responsive layout**: works comfortably across mobile and desktop
- **Dark mode support**: knows what your system says
- **Internationalization**: English and Indonesian

### Tech Stack

- **Nuxt** — the progressive web framework
- **Vue** — component-based UI
- **TypeScript** — type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
