## Contingency Contract

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3aedf34f-8dbc-48bf-b2a0-0b2ba09b4e01/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/axelmychro/deploys)

Built to showcase my projects and approach to frontend development. It's designed to be clean, fast, and expressive without clutter.

### Philosophy

Clear layouts, readable typography, and intentional motion.  
This site focuses on visual contrast and smooth transitions, so the content stays readable while still feeling alive.

I value component-based architecture and small, focused pieces over large monolithic structures, both in design and in code.

### Features

### Tech Stack
